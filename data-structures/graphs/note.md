# Graph Algorithms
- A graph G is simply a way of encoding pairwise relationships among a set of objects.
- Node in a graph is also frequently called a vertex.
- Vertices and edges are positions an store elements. When an edge connects two vertices, the vertices are said to be adjacent to each other and the edge is incident on both vertices.
- The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on it.
- A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex
- In weighted graphs integers (weights) are assigned to each edge to represent (distances or costs)
- `|V|`: number of vertices.
- `|E|`: number of edges. It can range between from 0 to $$|v|(|v|-1) \over 2$$ (in undirected graph)
