# Trees
## Binary Trees
- A tree is called binary tree if each node has zero child, one child or two children.
- The height of a node is a length of the path from that node to the deepest node. The height of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree.
- A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a height of zero.
- The heigh of the tree is the maximum height among all the nodes in the tree.

## Operations on Binary Trees
- Inserting an element into a tree
- Deleting an element from a tree
- Searching for an element
- Traversing the tree
- Finding the size of the tree
- Finding the height of the tree
- Finding the level which has maximum sum
- Finding the least common ancestor (LCA) for a given pair of nodes

## Traversals
- An action on the current node (referred to as 'visting' the node and denoted with 'D'), traversing to the left child node (denoted with 'L'), and traversing to the right child node (denoted with 'R')
- PreOrder (DLR) Traversal
- InOrder (LDR) Traversal
- PostOrder (LRD) Traversal
