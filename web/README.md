## Web Applications
- A web application is a computer program that responds to an HTTP request by a client and sends HTML back to the client in an HTTP response.
- An application is a software program that interacts with a user and helps the user to perform an activity.
- HTTP is a simple, stateless, text-based client-server protocol used in exchanging data between a client and server.
- Handlers receive HTTP requests and process them.
